# draw-y.cpp

This program generates a pattern resembling the letter 'Y' using asterisks (*). The user can input the height and width of the letter 'Y' to customize the appearance of the pattern.

----

## Getting Started

To compile and run the program, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `draw-y.cpp` file.
3. Use a C++ compiler (e.g., g++) to compile the code: g++ draw-y.cpp -o draw-y
4. Run the compiled executable: ./draw-y

## Usage

1. The program will prompt you to enter the height of the letter 'Y'. This determines the size of the letter.
2. Next, you'll be asked to enter the width of the letter 'Y'. This will affect the thickness of the letter's branches.
3. After entering the required values, the program will display the pattern resembling the letter 'Y'.

## Code Explanation

The code defines a `main()` function that uses loops and conditional statements to create the letter 'Y' pattern using asterisks and spaces. It takes user inputs for height and width and then constructs the top and bottom halves of the 'Y' accordingly.
